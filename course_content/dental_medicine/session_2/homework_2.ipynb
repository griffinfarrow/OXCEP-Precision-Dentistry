    "## Prostate Adenocarcinoma: A Clinical Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Prostate adenocarcinoma is one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. While many prostate cancers are indolent and slow-growing, a significant proportion progress to more aggressive disease, leading to metastasis and mortality. One of the central challenges in prostate cancer management is distinguishing between **low-risk, indolent tumors** and those that are likely to become **clinically significant and life-threatening**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional clinical indicators (like PSA levels, Gleason score, and tumor stage) are valuable but often **insufficient** to capture the underlying biological heterogeneity of the disease. More precise molecular tools are needed to improve risk stratification and guide personalized treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is DESNT?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DESNT** (pronounced \"descent\") is a **molecular subtype** of prostate cancer identified through gene expression profiling. It was first described through unsupervised clustering of large-scale transcriptomic data. Tumors classified as DESNT exhibit a distinct gene expression signature associated with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Poor prognosis**\n",
    "- **Early biochemical recurrence**\n",
    "- **More aggressive clinical behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other prostate cancer subtypes, DESNT is consistently linked to **worse clinical outcomes**, making it a potential marker for identifying high-risk patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Predict DESNT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict whether a prostate tumor is DESNT or not has major clinical implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It could **support early intervention** for patients likely to experience aggressive disease.\n",
    "- It may help **avoid overtreatment** in non-DESNT cases by identifying those with lower-risk tumors.\n",
    "- It could serve as a foundation for **biomarker discovery** and **treatment targeting**, as we continue to understand what biologically drives the DESNT phenotype.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will use RNA-seq gene expression data from prostate cancer patients to **train a machine learning model that predicts DESNT status**. This mirrors real-world translational research efforts that aim to bring molecular signatures from the lab into clinical use."

To simplify things for this project, we willl group all 8 \"indolent\" subtypes as \"DESNT-negative\", and the 2 aggressive subtypes as \"DESNT-positive\".  \n",

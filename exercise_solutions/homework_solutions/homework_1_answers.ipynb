    "## Clinical Background: Identifying HPV Status from RNA Data in Head and Neck Cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a key etiological factor in a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), particularly those arising in the oropharynx[1]. HPV-positive HNSCC is clinically and biologically distinct from HPV-negative disease[2]. Patients with HPV-positive tumors generally have a better prognosis and respond more favorably to treatment[3], which has led to the development of de-escalation strategies in clinical trials[4]. Therefore, accurate determination of HPV status is critical for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.\n",

    "### Traditional Detection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinically, HPV status is typically determined through p16 immunohistochemistry (as a surrogate marker), in situ hybridization, or PCR-based methods for detecting viral DNA or RNA[5]. However, with the increasing availability of high-throughput sequencing data, computational approaches now offer alternative ways to infer HPV status using RNA expression profiles[6]."

    "### Why Use RNA-seq Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a comprehensive snapshot of gene expression levels across the entire transcriptome. Tumors driven by HPV often exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures, not only due to the presence of viral transcripts, but also because HPV-related oncogenesis affects host gene expression patterns[7]. This makes RNA-seq a valuable tool for distinguishing between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancers using machine learning techniques[8]."

    "### About the Dataset: TCGA and Pan-Cancer Atlas\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this task comes from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, specifically the **Pan-Cancer Atlas** collection[9]. TCGA is a landmark cancer genomics program that has molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples across 33 cancer types. The Pan-Cancer Atlas is an integrated dataset that combines genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical information across multiple cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC)[10].\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you'll be working with **RNA-seq data** from **head and neck cancer biopsies** in TCGA, where the **HPV status** of each patient has been annotated. The goal is to use these RNA profiles to build a model that can **classify patients as HPV-positive or HPV-negative** based on their gene expression patterns.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We have pre-processed the data to make the task more enjoyable. Whilst RNA-seq can pick up over 24,000 genes, we've taken only 1000 of them. We've also normalised the gene expression levels so that they all appear between 0 and 1. Machine learning methods work better when all of the features (genes in this case) have values that are on the same scale as each other (rather than some being much larger or smaller than others!)."

    "The assignment here is to use the RNA profiles provided to build a machine learning model that will be able to classify patients as HPV-positive or HPV-negative based on their gene expression patterns.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We will use a **random forest algorithm** to do this. Random forests are a great, general-purpose machine learning algorithm when you are dealing with **tabular data**. This is data that can be conveniently written down in a table (like a spreadsheet).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "More complicated machine learning methods, such as neural networks, tend to be too complex to work well in tabular data. They often end up fitting noise in the data, rather than overall trends, leading to them performing worse than random forests.\n",

    "The tasks are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Import the libraries you need for your work\n",

    "  \n",
    "In this homework, you have learned how to: \n",
    "* import python libraries for data science\n",
    "* load a dataset and prepare it for model building with train-test splitting \n",
    "* build and train a random forest machine learning model \n",
    "  \n",
    "This workflow is the same for most machine learning applications, so these are important stages to understand.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Next Session \n",

    "A course instructor will go through this completed workbook with you, offering feedback and checking your work.  \n",

    "We have only built the model, not tested how well it works. This is the process of \"model evaluation\". We will discuss this in detail in the next session. \n",

    "\n",
    "## What improvements could be made? \n",
    "  \n",
    "The workflow that we have shown (data load -> train-test split -> build model) will be the same for nearly all machine learning applications, but there are many more advanced things that we might do along the way. Here, we talk about some of those\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Data Cleaning  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We have deliberately prepared a dataset for this task that is clean. In reality, this is nearly never the case. Data is messy; with errors, missing values and bias everywhere. A large part of the job of a data scientist is \"data cleaning\". This is the process of cleaning up the dataset by whatever means you can, so that it can be sensibly used in a machine learning application. This might include things like: \n",
    "* removing clear errors in the data \n",
    "* replacing missing values with some suitable alternative (maybe an average, or dropping them altogether)\n",
    "* visualising and exploring the data to check that it looks sensible \n",
    "* obtaining as much data as possible, to build better models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned earlier how important train-test splitting is for producing an unbiased estimate of how a model performs. It is *always* used. \n",
    "  \n",
    "However in many cases, this isn't really enough! We want to get confidence intervals on model performance, and understand how the model might perform if we used a different train-test split.  \n",
    "We do this with cross-validation. This is a way of training the model multiple times, using different splits of the data. Rather than getting one number for how a model performs, we get a distribution of values. We can use these to estimate things like the mean model performance, or how its performance might vary in different datasets. \n",
    "  \n",
    "In practice, we almost always use cross-validation when training models. It produces better estimates of model performance, especially when we only have a limited amount of data. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "  \n",
    "Earlier, we mentioned that machine learning algorithms have hyperparameters. These are parameters that the user sets that are not learned from the data (e.g. the number of trees in the random forest). Choosing sensible values of these is a critical part of building a machine learning model, and there are many different ways of doing it. We will not discuss these much here, but this article summarises some of the more important ones: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hyperparameter-tuning/\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Trying other models \n",
    "  \n",
    "We've talked about a random forest model; and for good reason, it is often considered \"good-enough\" for most use cases in machine learning on tabular data. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "*However, it is not the only model!*\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many, many different machine learning models that are all built on slightly different algorithms. A good practice for data science is to build different machine learning models to test the same problem. Other models may perform better.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing Thoughts\n",
    "  \n",
    "The most important thing to remember is that data science is an *iterative* process. It involves progressively improving models, trying small changes and different techniques to try to produce the best model at the task you are dealing with. We hope in this course to give you an introduction to these ideas, but a lot of work is needed to use them in clinical practice."
